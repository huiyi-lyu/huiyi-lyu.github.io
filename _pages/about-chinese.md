Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. Candidate of International Relations in the School of Social Sciences at Tsinghua University in Beijing. 
My research encompasses two main areas within the field of international relations. I study third-party intervention in civil wars and conflict governance, utilizing statistical and spatial analysis methods. Additionally, I explore state strategic narratives and soft power construction on social media platforms, employing computational social science approaches.

If you’re interested in discussing my research or exploring potential collaborations, please contact me at <lvhy22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn>.
