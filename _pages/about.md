Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. Candidate of [International Relations](https://www.dir.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in the [School of Social Sciences](https://www.sss.tsinghua.edu.cn) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn). I previously served as a visiting scholar at Stanford University's [Asia-Pacific Research Center (APARC)](https://aparc.fsi.stanford.edu/). I hold an MSc in Social Science of the Internet from the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/)(2021), as well as an MA (2020) and BA (2018) from [China Foreign Affairs University (CFAU)](https://en.cfau.edu.cn/).

My research encompasses two main areas within the field of international relations. I study third-party involvement in civil wars and conflict management, utilizing statistical and spatial analysis methods. Additionally, I explore state strategic narratives and soft power construction on social media platforms such as Twitter and Weibo, employing computational social science methods including large language models (LLMs) for text analysis, sentiment inference, and narrative tracing.

If you’re interested in discussing my research or exploring potential collaborations, please contact me at <lvhy22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn>.
