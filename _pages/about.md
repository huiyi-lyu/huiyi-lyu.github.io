Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. Candidate of [International Relations](https://www.dir.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in the [School of Social Sciences](https://www.sss.tsinghua.edu.cn) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn). Currently, I am a visiting scholar at the Asia-Pacific Research Center, Stanford University. My academic background includes an MSc in Social Science of the Internet from the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) (2021), as well as an MA (2020) and BA (2018) from [China Foreign Affairs University (CFAU)](https://en.cfau.edu.cn/).

My research encompasses two main areas within the field of international relations. I study third-party involvement in civil wars and conflict management, utilizing statistical and spatial analysis methods. Additionally, I explore state strategic narratives and soft power construction on social media platforms such as Twitter and Weibo, employing computational social science approaches.

If youâ€™re interested in discussing my research or exploring potential collaborations, please contact me at <lvhy22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn>.
