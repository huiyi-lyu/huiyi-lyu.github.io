Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. Candidate of [International Relations](https://www.dir.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in the [School of Social Sciences](https://www.sss.tsinghua.edu.cn) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn) in Beijing. I received an MSc in Social Science of the Internet from [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) in 2021, an MA from [Institute of International Relations](https://iir.cfau.edu.cn/) at China Foreign Affairs University [(CFAU)](https://en.cfau.edu.cn/) in 2020, and a BA in Diplomacy from CFAU in 2018.

My research encompasses two main areas within the field of international relations. I study third-party intervention in civil wars and conflict governance, utilizing statistical and spatial analysis methods. Additionally, I explore state strategic narratives and soft power construction on social media platforms such as Twitter and Weibo, employing computational social science approaches.

If youâ€™re interested in discussing my research or exploring potential collaborations, please contact me at <lvhy22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn>.
