Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. Candidate of [International Relations](https://www.dir.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in the [School of Social Sciences](https://www.sss.tsinghua.edu.cn) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn) in Beijing. 

My research encompasses two main areas within the field of international relations. I study third-party intervention in civil wars and conflict governance, utilizing statistical and spatial analysis methods. Additionally, I explore state strategic narratives and soft power construction on social media platforms, employing computational social science approaches.

If youâ€™re interested in discussing my research or exploring potential collaborations, please contact me at <lvhy22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn>.
